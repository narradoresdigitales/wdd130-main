      <h3>Education and Professional Experience</h3>
      
        <p>I truly enjoy learning. Research, writing, and teaching are at the forefront of my professional experience. My interests in academic journals and government contracting have provided me with many opportunities to broaden my work experiences and skill sets. I hold an academic or professional position performing these tasks and pursuing a BA in Software Development at Brigham Young University-Idaho. 
        <p>My immediate goal is to continue to gain knowledge and experience with web stacks and artificial intelligence through my coursework and projects. I expect to complete my first certificate in "Web and Computer Programming" next year (Dec 2024), and before completing my second certificate in "Web Development" (Jul 2025), my goal is to secure position as a Frontend or Full-Stack Developer. I will continue to work toward my third certificate and satisfy the degree requirements for the BS in Software Development.</p>
