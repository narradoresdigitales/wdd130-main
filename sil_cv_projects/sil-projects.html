            <h2>Preface</h2>
            <p class="summary">Too often, the wonderful world of web and computer does not enter the cosmology of academics strongly rooted in the Humanities. It seemed that the most significant debate among peers was the preference for a 'Mac' or 'Windows' machine. 
            <p>It was during my graduate studies that I began to work with linux based operating systems and without knowing it initiated a decades long programming hobbies that culminated for me when I submitted my Ph.D dissertation compiled with LaTex running on an Unbuntu OS.

                <h4 class="pdf_text">PDF to text</h4>
                <p>To avoid from saving a pdf to a word document or relying on your ability to copy, paste, and format; I researched python data extraction. Here enter the name of the file on line 5. The extracted text will appear in the terminal.</p>

                <h4>Python Translate</h4>
                <p>The next step is to copy the text from your terminal into the translator.translate function, coincidentally on line 5 and run the program. Your translation will appear in the terminal.</p>

            <p>Frustrated with the tedious task of using tools such as O transcribe as a platform to perform transcriptions of audio and video files for applied linguistics classes, Whisper.ai is a valuable tool that saves a significant amount of time. The source language is detected by default, you have the option to indicate the original language as you enter the run command using Anaconda prompt to activate a local environment. If this is not enough, you can use this value to simultaneously perform a translation of the transcription.
